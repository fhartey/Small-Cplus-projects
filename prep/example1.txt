4 principals of OOP
1) what is Encaplsation 
Encaplastion allows us to  take a piece of code that is repetitive and put it into a function. 
Usually we would want to make the function as reusable as possible so that we are able to call that function in other parts of are program, 
and allow it to take parameters that give us different resultsIn turn Encapacltion allows for a cleaner and more reusable code base.

2) WHAT IS INHERITANCEInheritance 
allows us to to inherit or take all of another class functions and properties and use those in a brand new class where we can create new properties in. 
Basically Inhetrinces allows use to reuse code,  keeping are code base shorter and more ogrinazed.

// This one needs more work of understanding
3) what is abstraction
Abstraction is where you have a class with functions that are already create and ready to use.
 This was you have abstract class that has set functions that already do what they need to do.

Polymorphism can be applied in two simple ways
Method Overloading
Method Overriding

1) Method Overloading1.a) When a class has multiple methods with the same names but a different set of parameters, it is called Method overloading. 
You can proceed with method overloading, only if your methods satisfy any one of the following rules 
 Have method with the same name and different parameters, or return types.

// this one needs work and more understanding

2) Method Overriding
1.A)The second way to go ahead with polymorphism is method overriding. This is only possible if a subclass ( or ) sister class has the same method as the parent class.
 Much like Method overloading, there are also some rules for method overriding to work.


What is the difference between abstract class and interface 
So two different classes have the same method  and one class is used  as interface or is inheritedthe method will need the same parameters and return types,but then inside the function the function can implant different code, and depend on when you create the object and call that function, it will do the implanted code that was done in that septic class.


abstact class is where you can have pre named function that are not implented adn have functions that are implmented
where then a class can intehit and the functions that are not implmented that class can create there own implention of them
and where the ones that are implented that class will now be able to implemnt them as well

Where as interface all the function are not implented yet, and is used for a class to inhiterit it, and make its own implention of those set functigons




What is a Singleton
a class where you tend to only have a single instance of that class, or struct

mainly to orgainze a bunch of global varibles and static functions that may pr may not act apon those varibles

no constructor or we will need to instanitate it.

Use unique_ptr when you want a single pointer to an object that will be reclaimed when that single pointer is destroyed. this unqiue pointer can not
coppy other unique pointers

Use shared_ptr when you want multiple pointers to the same resource. Shared pinters can always equal eachoter hae mutiples the ref counter will go up 



Intermediate experience with modern C++ 
(smart pointers, containers, maps), 
and use of abstract classes with pure virtual methods


What is the most proudest project you have worked on?
The most proudest project that i have worked on was  createing the radar control for my current employer

what was a challenging thing that you had to over come in the project?

The most chllenging part i had to over come was fitting these control in the legacy system, working on very lose base requirments from the cutmoer
this was challenging because the custimer wasnt sure want they wanted so there were my re itterations of itwhile we tested it to gether and
 i would have to come up with  solutions on the fly to give them exactly what they wanted

 Q1. Questions on C++. Was asked to implement a queue with key and value pair,
 
  questions on C++ concepts like oops, 
  
 Shallow copy -> You just copy the pointer address, 
 basically the your new variable will point to the original object's memory location. 
 Thus, if your new variable is modified, the original object will get modified.
 eg int b = new int(10); int* a = &b. 

Deep copy -> The original object is copied physically copied
and your new variable will hold that copy. 
If your new variable is modified, the original object will not be modified,
as it is physically a different thing. eg int b = 10; int a = b.

  function pointers, 
  Function pointers allows for you functions to become pointers, so you can have a varible set to that void function and 
  what it does it take the instructions of that function and stores it in are varible

  a good example is you can add function pointer to paramet of different function
  Then if you have have other functions you want to call inside that you can start passing the actual functions as aparemet to 
  the function that has the function pinter parameters

  Tell me about virtual Function


  
  smart pointer etc.

  A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of an object. 
  Pointers are used extensively in both C and C++ for three main purposes: to 
  allocate new objects on the heap, to pass functions to other functions. to i
  terate over elements in arrays or other data structures.

   reference variable is an alias, that is, another name for an already existing variable. 
   Once a reference is initialized with a variable, either the variable name or the 
   reference name may be used to refer to the variable.

    a pointer variable points to a variable whose memory location is stored in it. 
    The reference variable is an alias for a variable which is assigned to it.


How would you sort a list and what is the most efficient way to find a number in a list 
I would use quick sort to sort a list

You want pick a pivot element in an array then
Go from right to left if the number is bigger then the pivoit then put that before it and if it’s smaller then put that behind it.
Once you can’t do this anymore break it up and then redo the process until it’s fully sorted


If the array is sorted I would use binary search
Which is when we start in the middle of the array and compare it the number we want to find, if it isn’t the number we know can get rid of that half then repeat the process until we find the number


    Merge sort is better for larger satay sets quick sort is better for small data sets
